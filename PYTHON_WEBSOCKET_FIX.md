# Fix for Python WebSocket Server

## The Problem
Your Python CyberShellX server is getting this error:
```
RuntimeError: no running event loop
```

This happens when trying to start a WebSocket server in a thread without properly setting up the asyncio event loop.

## The Solution

### Option 1: Fix the existing code
In your `cybershellx_server.py` file, modify the `start_websocket_server` function:

```python
def start_websocket_server():
    # Create new event loop for this thread
    loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
    asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
    
    async def handler(websocket, path):
        # Your WebSocket handler code here
        pass
    
    async def main():
        server = await websockets.serve(handler, "localhost", 8765)
        logging.info("WebSocket server started on ws://localhost:8765")
        await server.wait_closed()
    
    try:
        loop.run_until_complete(main())
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        logging.info("WebSocket server stopped")
    finally:
        loop.close()
```

### Option 2: Use the provided fix
Use the `python_websocket_fix.py` file I created as a reference for the proper asyncio setup.

## Alternative: Use the React Version
The React/Node.js version we migrated to Replit doesn't have this issue and provides the same terminal interface functionality. You can:

1. Continue with the React version on Replit (already working)
2. Download and run the React version locally following LOCAL_SETUP.md
3. Fix the Python version using the code above

## Ports Summary
- Python WebSocket server: port 8765
- Python web interface: port 5173 (if using Vite)
- React/Node.js version: port 5000
