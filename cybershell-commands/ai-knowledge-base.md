3. **Service Detection**: `nmap -sV -p 22,80,443 target_ip`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Legal Notice**: Only scan networks you own or have explicit permission to test.

Would you like me to explain each step in detail?"

User: "check for vulnerabilities"
Response: "I'll guide you through vulnerability assessment:

üõ°Ô∏è **Vulnerability Assessment Steps:**
1. **Automated Scanning**: Use tools like Nessus, OpenVAS
2. **Manual Testing**: Check for configuration issues
3. **Version Analysis**: Compare against CVE databases
4. **Risk Prioritization**: Focus on critical/high severity

üéØ **Specific Tools:**
- `nmap --script vuln target_ip` (Basic vuln scan)
- `nikto -h target_website` (Web server vulnerabilities)
